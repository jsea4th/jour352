<p>Why did the University of Maryland move from the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) to the Big Ten? It was mainly for financial security for the university when it comes to athletics. While Maryland athletics generally have been successful with conference championships and have a few national championships, the university would like to focus on football and basketball. </p>
<p>Since joining the Big Ten conference, Maryland Football has had a record of 28 wins and 47 losses, <a href="https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/schools/maryland/index.html">according to the site </a> of the two sports. Maryland basketball on the other hand has tallied 145 wins and 56 losses according to the site  Of the two sports, Maryland basketball has been more successful since joining the Big Ten. </p>

<p>Since joining the conference in 2014, Maryland has seen growth in financial revenue every year. In their first year in the conference, Maryland’s revenue increased to nearly $93 million dollars which is a $19 million jump from their last year in the ACC, according to <a href="https://www.nbcsports.com/washington/maryland-terps/ncaa-finances-maryland-increases-revenue-total-second-big-ten-season"> NBC Sports Washington.</a> While Maryland’s finances continue to grow as the school establishes themselves in the conference, they are still currently on the bottom tier of teams when it comes to revenue and finances, as well as when it comes to wins and success on the field in certain sports such as football. </p>

<p>While Maryland has seen some success, such as the Men’s Soccer team winning the national championship in 2018, the university has a lot of work to do to be compared to other Big Ten powerhouses like Michigan and Ohio State, amongst others.
So what has the university done in response? Increased investments into new sports facilities at Maryland. The Cole Field House is soon to be completed after the over $200 million renovation it has undergone the last few years,<a href="https://dbknews.com/2019/09/29/cole-field-house-cost-55-million/"> according to The Diamondback.</a>

<p>Earlier this year, Maryland athletic director Damon Evans <a href="http://mpower.maryland.edu/university-of-maryland-embarking-on-ambitious-25-million-campaign-to-upgrade-athletic-facilities/">unveiled the new plan for all facilities on campus.</a> In the press release, Evans said, “We are going to invest 25 million dollars in our Olympic sport facilities”. He says this mission will be called the “Building Champions” project. Each university sport who is receiving a makeover took to twitter to show off simulations of their respective fields. The soccer program shared the following tweet to showcase <a href="https://twitter.com/MarylandMSoccer/status/1214959274121670657?s=20">improvements to their facility.</a></p>

<p>The Gossett Football team house will also undergo many changes and improvements. The football program also tweeted <a href="https://twitter.com/TerpsFootball/status/1214975216725700609?s=20">their vision of what their facilities will look like.</a> Field Hockey, baseball, softball, golf, and track and field will have a makeover to their facilities as well.
We are just beginning to see how joining the Big Ten is paying off for Maryland athletics. While the revenue sports are still adjusting to the conference, , it is clear the revenue for athletics increases every year and the school is taking measures to have facilities to the standard of other powerhouses in the conference.</p>

<p>Finally, as years go on, Maryland anticipates the programs will become more competitive as they spend more years in the Big Ten. The impact this transition of conferences has on recruiting and recruiting classes is yet to be seen. Maryland athletics is a big generator of money for the university, so developments in athletics are crucial from a financial standpoint.</p>
